re-examine laminar difference of SMI and BMI

MUAResponse_Layer_ver2_0.mat
 - first version of re-analysis generated by Extract_MUAResponse_layer_ver2.m
 - define superficial layer as channels above Mid to Upper Layer 3 (including the Mid to Upple Layer 3 itself)
 - define deep (infragranular) layer as channels below Layer 5 (including the Layer 5 itself)
 => number of active channels in superficial layer might be too small...

MUAResponse_Layer_ver2.mat
 - did the analysis again by loosen the layer boundary criteria in superficial layers
 - define superficial layer as channels above Lower Layer 3 (EXCLUDING the Lower Layer 3!)
 - define deep (infragranular) layer as channels below Layer 5 (same as ver2_0)
 => result looks better
